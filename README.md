# AetherTradeRPG

AetherTradeRPG is set in a vast, interconnected patchwork of realms, each with its own unique aesthetic, culture, and backstory. Imagine a constellation of floating worlds, each a pocket reality stitched together by ancient magic and powerful runes. These worlds are linked by mysterious gateways, forming a cosmic marketplace of adventure, commerce, and rivalry. Across these realms, players can carve out their own destiny as adventurers, traders, explorers, or cunning dealmakers.
